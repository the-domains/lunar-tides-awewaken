A world traveling Freedom Dancer, Moon Mother, Writer, Life Lover, Surfer, Yogini, Priestess and Ceremonial Artist.

My strong love for the Ocean, guided me to dedicate my life to helping Women heal their Womb. Inspiring healing and transformation through Body Mind & Spirit Journeys and Retreats; using Alchemy, Yoga, Meditation, Kundalini Tantra, Music, Dance, Chakra Balancing, Pranayama, and Ceremonial Healing Rituals.

The Warrior of the Womb is a path I walk as a Priestess and a Moon Mother. Embodying the Divine Feminine within myself with integrity so I may inspire women to unleash the Wild Feminine Essence, Beauty & Power through the connection to the Moon Rhythms and our Womb Heart. 

Awakening Creativity, Spirituality, Sensuality and Life Purpose.

My Mission is to awaken Women towards the journey of Rising in love with their Divine Self and bring the Union of Masculine & Feminine within to magnetize the Divine Relationship with a Beloved and ultimately raise the vibration of Unity Consciousness within us, our community and on Planet Earth.

As we Awaken to Unity ~ Gaia is Awakening to manifest as Heaven on Earth.
